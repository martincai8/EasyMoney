# My Personal Project

## A budgeting app
  

*Q: What will this app do?*  
A: This app will help users keep track of their monthly expenses, categorize their spending, and calculate their
net worth.  

*Q: Who will use this app?*  
A: Budgeting can be very time-consuming and complicated, which results in many failing to stick to it long-term.
This app is aimed for users who want a simple, yet effective way to track their spending.

*Q: Why am I interested in this project?*  
A: As a university student, I know how important it is to be able to manage my finances well. I hope that this app
can help me apply what I've learned in class and integrate it into an app that will help me in real life. As mentioned
above, I find that I tend to stop using budgeting apps like Mint because there are too many complicated features. I
want to develop an app is intuitive and useful.
