# My Personal Project

## A budgeting app
  

*Q: What will this app do?*  
A: This app will help users keep track of their monthly expenses, categorize their spending, and calculate their
net worth.  

*Q: Who will use this app?*  
A: Budgeting can be very time-consuming and complicated, which results in many failing to stick to it long-term.
This app is aimed for users who want a simple, yet effective way to track their spending.

*Q: Why am I interested in this project?*  
A: As a university student, I know how important it is to be able to manage my finances well. I hope that this app
can help me apply what I've learned in class and integrate it into an app that will help me in real life. As mentioned
above, I find that I tend to stop using budgeting apps like Mint because there are too many complicated features. I
want to develop an app is intuitive and useful.

##User stories
1. As a user, I want to be able to add new expense entries to a list of existing expenses.
2. As a user, I want to be able to view all my expenses during each selected month.
3. As a user, I want to be able to view all my expenses that belong to a certain category 
(e.g., restaurants, groceries).
4. As a user, I want to be able to delete an entry from my list of expenses.
5. As a user, I want to be able given the option to load an existing list of expenses when I start the program.
6. As a user, I want to be given the option to save my list of expenses when I quit the app.

##Phase 4: Task 3  
- I would find a way to let external classes access and modify fields in the GUI class, which would get rid of the 3
"extends" relationships for AddExpensePanel, HomePagePanel, and StartUpPanel
- I would add more helper methods in some of my longer classes so the code is more readable
- I would implement an observer design whenever I add or delete an expense instead of manually refreshing the expense
lists every time something happened
